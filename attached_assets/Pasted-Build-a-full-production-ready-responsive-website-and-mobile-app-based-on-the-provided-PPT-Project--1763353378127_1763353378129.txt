Build a full production-ready responsive website and mobile app based on the provided PPT "Project - 1: Total Sales Prediction for Cinema Tickets". The product must implement a dynamic pricing & total sales prediction system for cinema tickets using ML, plus a complete front-end, back-end, admin dashboard, mobile app, CI/CD, tests and deployment instructions.

High-level goals

Public website for users to view movies, showtimes, seats, prices, and buy tickets.

Mobile app (iOS & Android) with same features, fully responsive UI and offline-friendly behavior.

Admin dashboard to manage movies, shows, base price, occupancy, view ML predictions, and override dynamic pricing.

Machine learning microservice that predicts total sales and suggests dynamic ticket prices (supports linear and non-linear regression).

Secure REST API + token-based auth; payments simulated or integrated with a sandbox (e.g., Stripe test mode).

Containerized apps with Docker and deployment instructions (e.g., Docker Compose, optional Kubernetes helm).

Tech stack (recommended; you may substitute but keep API boundaries):

Frontend web: Next.js (React) + Tailwind CSS, responsive design system.

Mobile: React Native (Expo) or Flutter (specify: React Native preferred to reuse React code).

Backend: Node.js + Express (or NestJS) for REST API.

ML service: Python (FastAPI) exposing prediction endpoints. Model code using scikit-learn + joblib (for linear regression and polynomial/non-linear regression) and training scripts.

Database: PostgreSQL (production) + Redis (caching). Optionally MongoDB for flexible data.

Auth: JWT + refresh tokens, role-based (user, admin).

CI/CD: GitHub Actions workflows (lint/test/build/image push).

Containerization: Docker + Docker Compose.

Tests: Jest + React Testing Library for frontend, Mocha/Jest for backend, PyTest for ML service.

Monitoring: Basic logging, and Prometheus-friendly metrics endpoints (optional).

Functional requirements — Website & Mobile App

Public pages:

Home: Featured movies, upcoming shows, top predictions (sales forecast).

Movie detail: Poster, synopsis, cast, duration, showtimes (list by date), seat map.

Show booking flow: select showtime → choose seats → see live ticket price (from pricing API) → payment → booking confirmation + e-ticket.

Search & filter: by movie name, genre, date, language.

User account: signup/login, bookings history, profile.

Admin dashboard:

CRUD for movies, theaters, screens, showtimes.

View occupancy / historical sales per show.

Trigger ML retrain with dataset upload.

Display ML predictions: expected tickets sold, recommended dynamic pricing change (percentage).

Manual override pricing per show.

Audit logs for price changes.

Booking & payment:

Prevent double-booking of same seat.

Reservation timeout (e.g., hold seats 10 minutes).

Payment options: mock UPI/COD/credit-card flow; integrate Stripe test mode for card payments.

Dynamic pricing & ML:

ML microservice endpoint /predict accepting features (show_id, base_price, screen_capacity, date_time, historical_occupancy, weekday/holiday flag, location, weather optional, promotional_flag).

Return: predicted_total_tickets, confidence, recommended_price (suggested dynamic price).

API for GET /pricing/show/:id to return current price (base price adjusted by ML recommendation + admin overrides).

Support batch prediction for admin analytics.

Data & preprocessing:

Normalization pipeline for numeric features.

Feature engineering: occupancy rate, days-to-show, time-of-day bucket, weekend/weekday, holiday flag.

Save training metadata and model versioning.

Security:

Input validation & sanitization.

Rate limiting on public endpoints.

Secure storage of secrets (use .env and note vault recommendations).

Performance & UX:

Responsive design across breakpoints (mobile / tablet / desktop).

Lazy load images/posters; server-side rendering for SEO with Next.js.

Accessibility (WCAG basic compliance).

Analytics & logging:

Track key metrics: conversion rate, no. of tickets sold per show, revenue, model performance (RMSE/MAE), A/B test flags for pricing.

Developer & deployment:

Provide Dockerfiles for each service; a docker-compose.yml that brings up web, backend, ml-service, and db.

Provide GitHub Actions for CI: run tests, lint, build images.

Provide README with setup & sample env variables and deployment steps for a VPS or cloud (AWS ECS/EKS or DigitalOcean).

Deliverables:

Full source code repo with clear monorepo or microservice layout.

SQL schema + sample seed data (including synthetic dataset for ML training reflecting features in PPT).

Trained model artifact (or training script with commands).

Postman collection or OpenAPI spec for backend and ML service.

End-to-end tests (booking flow smoke test).

Developer docs: how to run locally, how to retrain model, how to deploy.

API design (minimum endpoints)

POST /auth/signup, POST /auth/login, POST /auth/refresh

GET /movies, GET /movies/:id

GET /shows?movie_id=&date=, GET /shows/:id/seats

POST /booking (body: user_id, show_id, seats[], payment_method)

GET /booking/:id

GET /pricing/show/:id -> returns { current_price, source: 'ml|override|base', recommended_price, model_version }

POST /admin/movies, PUT /admin/movies/:id, etc.

POST /ml/predict (features)

POST /ml/train (admin trigger, optional dataset upload)

ML microservice details

Accept CSV or JSON training data. Implement pipeline:

Data cleaning (missing values).

Normalization / scaling.

Feature encoding (one-hot for categorical).

Model train: linear regression baseline; polynomial regression (or RandomForest/GradientBoosting) as non-linear option.

Evaluate and log metrics: RMSE, MAE, R²; save best model artifact with version.

Expose /predict endpoint returning prediction + explanation (feature importances or coefficients).

Provide sample notebooks or scripts to reproduce training.

Containerize model with a minimal FastAPI server that loads model artifact and serves predictions with low latency.

UI/UX guidance (deliverable)

Provide Figma frames or simple component spec:

Color palette, typography, spacing scale.

Components: MovieCard, ShowCard, SeatMap, BookingModal, AdminDataTable, PredictionCard.

Accessibility: tab order, aria labels on seat buttons.

Acceptance criteria — minimum

User can search movies, pick showtime, select seats, pay in sandbox, receive booking confirmation and e-ticket.

Admin can view ML predictions and apply price override.

ML /predict returns plausible values given sample data; model reproducible via provided training script.

Frontend passes basic end-to-end booking smoke test.

Project builds via Docker Compose and all services come up. /repo
  /web (Next.js)
  /mobile (React Native - Expo)
  /api (Node/Express)
  /ml (FastAPI + model scripts)
  /infra (docker-compose.yml, k8s/helm optional)
  /docs (API spec, setup, run, deploy)
Quality & tests

Provide unit tests for backend routes, ML unit tests for preprocessing, and a single e2e test for booking using Playwright or Cypress.
